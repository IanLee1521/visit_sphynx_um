Changing tube appearance
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Tube operator provides a few knobs that control the appearance of the generated tubes. First of all, the tube width can be set by typing a new width into the
**Width**
text field in the
**Tube operator attributes window **
(
). The number of polygons used to make up the circumference of the tube can be altered by typing a new number of sides into the
**Fitness of tube**
text field. Finally, the ends of tubes can be capped instead of remaining open by turning on the
**Cap Tubes**
check box.
