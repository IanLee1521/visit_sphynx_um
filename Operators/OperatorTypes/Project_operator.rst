Project operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Project operator sets all of the Z
values in the coordinates of a 3D mesh to zero and reduces the topological dimension of the mesh by 1. The Project operator is, in essence, an operator to make 2D meshes out of 3D meshes. An example of the Project operator is shown in
.

Setting the projection type
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Project operator can project 3D down to 2D using two different transforms: XY Cartesian, and ZR Cylindrical. To specify which of these transforms you want to use when using the Project operator, click on either the
**XYCartesian**
or
**ZRCylindrical**
radio buttons in the
**Project operator attributes window**
(see
).
