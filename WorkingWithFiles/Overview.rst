.. _Working With Databases Overview:

Overview
--------

In this chapter, we will discuss how to work with databases in VisIt. A 
database can be either a set of files on disk or a running simulation. You can 
manage both types of databases using the same VisIt windows. First we'll learn 
about :ref:`Supported File Types`, then the :ref:`File Open Window` which 
allows you to browse the local system or a remote host to find your files. 
Next, we'll learn how to open databases for visualization using the 
:ref:`Sources Pane`.  After that we'll learn how to control animation in the 
:ref:`Time Pane` before learning how to examine information about a database 
using the :ref:`File Information Window`.
