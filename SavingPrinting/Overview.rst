Overview
~~~~~~~~
In this chapter, we discuss how to save and print files from within VisIt. The
section on saving files is further broken down into three main areas: saving 
images, saving movies, and exporting databases. We first learn about saving 
images of visualizations using the **Save Window** and then we move on to 
saving movies and sets of image files using the **Save movie wizard**. After 
learning to save images and movies, this chapter concentrates on exporting 
databases to different file formats using the **Export Database window**. 
Finally, we learn to print images of visualizations using the 
**Printer Window**.
