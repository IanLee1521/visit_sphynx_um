Getting started
---------------

The rest of this manual details the ins and outs to using VisIt, but you can
also very quickly visualize your data by opening a database and creating
plots. You must first select databases to visualize. Sample data files are
usually installed with VisIt in a data directory in the directory in which
VisIt was installed. If you are running VisIt on the Windows platform, you
can double-click on one of the sample Silo data files to open it in VisIt
or you can run VisIt and open the **File Selection Window** from the
**Main Window's File** menu. Highlight some files and click the **Ok** button
in the **File Selection Window**. The **Main Window's File panel** should now
contain some files. To open a file, click on its entry in the File panel and
then click the **Open** button. If the database was successfully opened, the
**Plot and operator** menu will be enabled.

Once you have opened a database, you can use it to create a plot by selecting
a plot type and database variable from the **Plots** menu. Once a plot is
created, the **Active plots list** will show that the new plot has been added
by displaying a description of the plot drawn in green text. The color green
indicates that the plot is in the new state and has not been drawn yet. To
draw the plot, click the **Draw** button in the middle of the **Main Window**
. That's all there is to creating a plot using VisIt. For more detailed
information on creating plots and performing specific actions in VisIt,
refer to the other chapters in this book.
