Checking for new versions
-------------------------

A new version of VisIt is usually released every 2-3 months. You can check for new versions of VisIt on the VisIt Web site (
*https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit*
) or you can use the
**Check for new **
**version**
menu option in the
**Help**
menu to check for new versions of VisIt. If you click on
**Check for new version**
then VisIt will contact the VisIt web site and determine whether there are any updates available. If there are updates available, VisIt will prompt you for whether or not you would like to upgrade VisIt (see
).

If you choose to upgrade VisIt, VisIt will download the new platform-appropriate distribution file and proceed to install VisIt on your system. During download and installation, feedback on the progress of the installation is displayed to the
**Main Window's**
status bar as shown in
.

Once the installation of the new version of VisIt is complete, VisIt will ask whether you want to migrate your current session to the new version of VisIt (see
). If you choose to migrate your session, VisIt will save your session, quit and restart using the saved session in the new version of VisIt.
