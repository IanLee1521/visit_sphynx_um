Point Tool
----------

The point tool allows you to position a single point relative to plots that exist in the visualization
window. The point tool, shown in
, provides one hot point at the tool's origin. Clicking on the hot point and moving the mouse moves the point tool's origin in a plane perpendicular to the screen. Holding down the
*Shift*
key before clicking on the hot point moves the point tool's origin along the plot axis that most faces the user. Holding down the
*Ctrl*
key moves point tool along the plot axis that points up. The point tool is commonly used to set the origin for the ThreeSlice operator or set the location of a point streamline source for the Streamline plot.
